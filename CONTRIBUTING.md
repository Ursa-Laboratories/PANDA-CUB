# Contributing to CubOS

CubOS controls real lab hardware. Contributions are welcome, but changes need
to preserve the safety and abstraction boundaries that make the system usable
across gantries, instruments, labware, and protocols.

For installation, local setup, and project orientation, start with
[README.md](README.md). This guide covers contribution expectations.

## Pull Requests

- Open pull requests against `main`.
- Keep each PR focused on one behavior, bug fix, driver, workflow, or docs
  change.
- Explain the problem, the approach, and any user-facing behavior changes.
- Add or update tests for the behavior you changed.
- Keep documentation in sync when you change public CLI behavior, YAML schema,
  protocol semantics, hardware setup, calibration, or cross-repo interfaces.
- Do not include unrelated formatting, generated files, or cleanup in the same
  PR unless the PR is specifically for that work.

All CI checks should pass before a PR is merged. You do not need to run the
entire test suite locally for every small change, but run the smallest useful
tests while developing and make sure the PR is not relying on untested behavior.

CI enforces a diff-coverage gate for the core Python package: at least 90% of
the core lines added or changed by a PR must be executed by tests. To check
locally before pushing:

```bash
python -m pytest packages/core/tests --cov=packages/core/src/cubos --cov-report=xml -q
diff-cover coverage.xml --compare-branch=origin/main --fail-under=90
```

## Hardware-Facing Changes

Hardware-facing changes require hardware validation before merge. This includes
changes to gantry motion, calibration, setup scripts, protocol execution,
labware coordinate resolution, instrument drivers, vendor integrations, and
commands that actuate instruments.

In the PR description, state exactly:

- What hardware the change can affect.
- What offline validation you ran.
- What physical hardware you tested.
- The exact command, protocol, or script you ran.
- The specific actions you observed on hardware.
- Any hardware behavior you did not test.

Be concrete. For example, a pipette change should say which pipette hardware was
connected, which protocol or script was run, and whether aspirate, dispense,
tip pickup/drop, movement, and error paths were exercised. A gantry change
should say how homing, jog direction, bounds, travel height, and any relevant
protocol movement were checked.

Do not summarize hardware testing as "tested on hardware" without the details
above.

## Tests

Install development dependencies with the commands in [README.md](README.md).

Use focused tests while iterating, for example:

```bash
python -m pytest packages/core/tests/instruments -q
python -m pytest packages/core/tests/protocol_engine -q
python -m pytest packages/core/tests/deck -q
```

For hardware-adjacent configuration or protocol changes, also run the relevant
offline setup validation:

```bash
python -m cubos.tools.validate_setup \
  packages/core/configs/gantry/<gantry>.yaml \
  packages/core/configs/deck/<deck>.yaml \
  packages/core/configs/protocol/<protocol>.yaml
```

For documentation changes, run:

```bash
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Instrument and Vendor Abstractions

Follow the existing instrument layout:

```text
packages/core/src/cubos/instruments/<type>/
  interface.py
  models.py
  exceptions.py
  vendors/<vendor>.py
```

Keep the boundary clear:

- Generic instrument behavior belongs in the type interface, shared models,
  shared exceptions, registry metadata, or protocol engine code.
- Vendor SDK calls, serial details, command translations, and device-specific
  quirks belong in `vendors/<vendor>.py`.
- Do not put vendor-specific behavior into protocol code or generic
  interfaces.
- Do not make the core package import proprietary or optional SDKs at module
  import time. Vendor SDK imports should be lazy and tied to connection or the
  method that needs them.
- New vendor dependencies should be optional extras in
  `packages/core/pyproject.toml`, not required core dependencies.
- Drivers should support `offline=True` when a meaningful dry-run behavior is
  possible.
- Register new built-in vendors in `packages/core/src/cubos/instruments/registry.yaml`.
- External or proprietary drivers should use the instrument registry entry
  point or `CUBOS_INSTRUMENT_REGISTRY_PATHS` overlay mechanism instead of
  merging private code into CubOS.

If a change feels like it needs to special-case one vendor in a shared layer,
re-check the abstraction before opening the PR.

## Commit and Branch Names

Use descriptive branch names:

```text
fix/pipette-aspirate-timeout
feat/uvvis-calibration-command
docs/getting-started-windows
```

Use conventional commits for commit messages:

```text
fix(pipette): handle aspirate timeout
feat(instruments): add thorlabs ccs health check
docs(calibration): clarify homing preflight
test(protocol): cover scan height validation
```

Common types are `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, and
`ci`.
