# Fluid State Tracking

CubOS can save the fluid contents of wells and vials in its SQLite database,
then resume that state in a later protocol run. A fluid state is associated
with the deck YAML that created it, so CubOS can reject a resume attempt made
with a different deck configuration.

Fluid tracking is optional. Protocols that do not create or resume a fluid
state continue to run without tracked contents.

## Prepare the deck and initial fluids

Give each volume-bearing labware item a stable key in the deck YAML. For
example, a reagent grid might be named `reagents` and a well plate
`assay_plate`. Protocol endpoints then use addresses such as
`reagents.buffer` or `assay_plate.A1`.

Aliases are convenient protocol names, but CubOS persists canonical
positions. If `buffer` is an alias for `A1`, a protocol may use
`reagents.buffer` while the saved state records `reagents.A1`.

Create an initial-fluids YAML file containing the starting volume and
composition of each non-empty location:

```yaml
fluids:
  reagents.buffer:
    volume_ul: 1000.0
    composition:
      buffer: 1000.0
  reagents.dye:
    volume_ul: 200.0
    composition:
      dye: 200.0
```

For every location, `volume_ul` must equal the sum of the component volumes.
Locations omitted from the seed start empty.

## Create a state

Use your own calibrated gantry and deck YAML files and your own reviewed
protocol. The first run creates and seeds a deck-linked state and prints its
numeric ID:

```bash
python setup/run_protocol.py \
  /path/to/gantry.yaml \
  /path/to/deck.yaml \
  /path/to/first-protocol.yaml \
  --database /path/to/cubos.db \
  --initial-fluids /path/to/initial-fluids.yaml
```

By default, this command connects to the configured gantry and instruments.
Add `--mock` to run it offline. Validate the exact gantry, deck, and protocol
files before running them:

```bash
python setup/validate_setup.py \
  /path/to/gantry.yaml \
  /path/to/deck.yaml \
  /path/to/first-protocol.yaml \
  /path/to/initial-fluids.yaml   # optional
```

When the optional initial-fluids YAML is supplied, validation also simulates
every `transfer`/`serial_transfer`/`mix` step against those starting volumes:
pipette-model volume bounds, vial `dead_volume_ul` floors, and destination
`working_volume_ul` overflow are all checked offline, so a protocol that
would fail its liquid-safety preflight mid-run fails here instead. Containers
not named in the file are treated as starting empty.

## Resume a state

Use the same database, the same deck configuration, and the ID printed by the
first run:

```bash
python setup/run_protocol.py \
  /path/to/gantry.yaml \
  /path/to/deck.yaml \
  /path/to/next-protocol.yaml \
  --database /path/to/cubos.db \
  --fluid-state-id STATE_ID
```

CubOS applies successful transfers and mixes to the persisted state. A mix is
journaled but does not change the tracked total volume or composition.

## Interrupted operations

If a pipette action fails after its journal entry starts, CubOS blocks resume
until the physical result is reconciled through the core `DataStore` fluid
state API. CubOS does not guess whether liquid moved after an interrupted
hardware action.

The repository's fluid-state YAML files under
`tests/fixtures/configs/fluid_state_resume/` contain fake coordinates and an
offline `/dev/null` gantry. They exist only for automated tests and are not
supported hardware configurations or operator examples.
