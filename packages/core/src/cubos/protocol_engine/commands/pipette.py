    ``require_uncapped`` (optional list of deck targets, typically
    ``source``/``destination`` themselves) is checked FIRST, before any
    other preflight or motion: every named target must be durably tracked
    ``uncapped`` (see ``cubos.data.cap_state``) or the command fails
    immediately with an error naming exactly which vial needs `decap`
    first. This is an explicit opt-in check only -- it never runs `decap`
    itself. A target with no durable cap state at all (not capper-managed)
    is not constrained by this check.

    Safety preflight runs entirely before any motion or durable journaling:
    rejects ``volume_ul <= 0``, volume below the configured pipette model's
    ``min_volume``, source draws that would cross its ``dead_volume_ul``
    floor, and destination fills that would exceed ``working_volume_ul``.
    Preflight and splitting only engage when *pipette* exposes a real
    ``PipetteConfig`` (see ``_liquid_transfer.pipette_capacity``); bare test
    doubles fall back to the single-stroke, unvalidated pre-Feature-04
    behavior.

    Volumes above the model's ``max_volume`` split deterministically into
    capacity-bounded strokes (``_liquid_transfer.plan_strokes``). Each
    stroke is its own durable fluid operation reusing the existing
    begin/complete journal (one ``operation_key`` per stroke, scoped via
    ``context.active_substep``): this makes a multi-stroke transfer a
    logically-one action whose per-stroke sub-state is independently
    recoverable -- a crash after stroke *N* leaves strokes ``< N`` applied
    and terminal, stroke *N* itself ``reconciliation_required`` (with a
    stroke-numbered detail message), and strokes ``> N`` never started; a
    rerun skips every already-applied stroke via the existing idempotent
    ``begin_fluid_transfer`` check and only executes what's left. No new
    schema/journal was needed for this -- it composes entirely from the
    tip_state/fluid_state two-phase begin/complete primitives.

    ``source_height``/``destination_height`` keep the existing
    labware-relative sign convention (0 = labware reference Z, negative =
    below). Leave them unset (``None``, the default) to opt into
    state-derived aspiration height: when durable fluid tracking is active
    and the target resolves to a ``Vial`` with known geometry, the engage Z
    tracks the current liquid surface (floored at the dead-volume/bottom
    clearance -- see ``_liquid_transfer.derive_liquid_relative_height``).
    Otherwise (untracked, non-vial, or missing geometry) falls back to the
    legacy default of ``0.0``, identical to pre-Feature-04 behavior. Passing
    an explicit numeric value (including ``0.0``) always wins.

    ``liquid_class`` selects a per-pipette-instrument volume correction
    (``cubos.instruments.pipette.liquid_class``; disabled/identity by
    default), applied to the *driver-commanded* stroke volume only --
    durable fluid-state updates always move the *requested* (uncorrected)
    volume, so tracked container state reflects what was asked for while
    hardware receives whatever correction is calibrated to actually deliver
    it.
