    Position resolution:
        1. ``[x, y, z]`` list/tuple → raw gantry move to the literal
           coordinates (applies only the instrument's mounting offsets).
        2. Named position from the protocol YAML ``positions:`` block →
           same raw move treatment.
        3. Deck target string (e.g. ``"plate_1.A1"``) → safe
           ``move_to_labware`` that retracts (if needed), travels XY at
           the gantry's absolute ``safe_z``, and ends above the target
           (no descent — use ``measure``/``aspirate``/etc. to engage).

    Args:
        context:    Runtime context (instrumented gantry, deck, logger).
        instrument: Name of the instrument registered on the gantry.
        position:   Named position, [x, y, z] list, or deck target string.
        travel_z:   Optional raw transit Z for literal/named XYZ moves.
                    When set, the gantry first moves Z to ``travel_z`` at
                    the current XY, then moves XY at that Z, then finishes
                    at ``position``.
