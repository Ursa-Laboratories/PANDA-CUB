"""Protocol commands for generic vial capper/decapper operations.

``decap``/``cap`` are built entirely from generic gantry primitives
(``InstrumentedGantry.move_to_labware``/``.move``, exactly like every other
instrument command) plus the vendor-agnostic
``cubos.instruments.capper.interface.CapperInstrument`` surface. No
vendor-specific behavior (Arduino command IDs, electromagnet, line-break
sensor parsing) appears here -- see
``cubos.instruments.capper.vendors.pawduino`` for that.

Sequencing is fixed and explicit for every decap/cap action:

1. **approach** -- travel to the vial XY at the gantry's absolute ``safe_z``
   (``InstrumentedGantry.move_to_labware``).
2. **engage** -- descend to ``vial.z + capper.engage_depth_mm`` (a
   labware-relative offset carried on the *instrument config*, not
   hardcoded here -- see ``CapperInstrument.engage_depth_mm``).
3. **capture**/**release** -- actuate (``capture_cap``/``release_cap``) and
   sensor-confirm (``read_cap_present``) the expected post-actuation state,
   retrying up to ``capper.capture_retries`` times.
4. **retract** -- ascend back to ``safe_z``.
5. **park** -- move to the instrument's configured ``park_position`` at
   ``safe_z``, so a captured/just-released cap is never left hovering over
   open labware.

A timeout or a sensor reading that contradicts the expected state after all
retries FAILS CLOSED: the tool is retracted to ``safe_z`` on a best-effort
basis, the durable cap state (when tracking is active) is marked
``reconciliation_required``, and a ``ProtocolExecutionError`` is raised --
no cap-state transition is recorded as applied. The same safe-retract path
runs for a mid-motion gantry failure at any stage, not just a sensor fault.
