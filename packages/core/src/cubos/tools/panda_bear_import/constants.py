"""Documented constants for the PANDA-BEAR -> CubOS import.

Tool offsets are copied verbatim from PANDA-BEAR's own tool table
(``src/panda_lib/hardware/grbl_cnc_mill/tools.json`` in the PANDA-BEAR repo).
PANDA-BEAR's driver computes ``gantry = tool_target + tool_offset`` per axis
(``grbl_cnc_mill/driver.py:_calculate_target_coordinates``, PANDA-BEAR repo);
:mod:`.conversion` mirrors that exact formula to turn a PANDA-BEAR DB
tool-point coordinate into a CubOS home-origin gantry-frame coordinate.

Override the defaults at the CLI with ``--tools-json`` if the physical tool
mounts change; see :mod:`.tools_json`.
